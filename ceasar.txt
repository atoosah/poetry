# A Soliloquy of Marc Antony from _Julius Ceasar_
0 pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times.
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quartered by the hands of war
